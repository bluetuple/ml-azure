**Title: Building a Simple AI Project: Extracting Text from Images Using Azure Cognitive Services and Terraform**

**Introduction:**
In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer confined to the realm of science fiction. It has become an accessible tool that can enhance various aspects of our lives. In this blog post, we will walk you through a small AI project that showcases the power of AI-driven image processing. We'll leverage Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, a collection of AI services and APIs, to extract text from images. To streamline the deployment of these services, we'll employ Terraform, an infrastructure-as-code tool. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a better understanding of how to integrate AI capabilities into your projects and automate the provisioning of resources.

**Summary:**
In this project, we will utilize Azure Cognitive Services, which provides various AI functionalities, including image analysis, speech recognition, and language understanding. Our focus will be on the Computer Vision service, which enables us to extract text from images. To achieve this, we will follow these steps:

1. **Azure Cognitive Services via Terraform:** We'll start by using Terraform to provision the required resources on Azure. This will include setting up the Cognitive Services account, configuring the API key, and enabling the Computer Vision service.

2. **Python Script for Text Extraction:** With the infrastructure in place, we'll write a Python script that interacts with the Cognitive Services API. The script will take an image as input, send it to the service, and retrieve the extracted text. We'll utilize the Azure SDK to simplify the API calls.

3. **Image Processing Workflow:** We'll outline the workflow of our project, starting from uploading an image to the service endpoint to receiving the extracted text. This will help you understand the sequence of actions involved.

**Python Script and API Interaction:**
We'll dive into the code that powers our AI project. The Python script will handle image uploading, API calls, and text extraction. We'll explain how to authenticate with the service using the API key, format the image data for API consumption, and process the API response to extract the relevant text.

**Terraform Configuration:**
Next, we'll explore the Terraform configuration files that define the infrastructure. We'll guide you through creating a Cognitive Services resource, setting up API keys, and enabling the Computer Vision service. The goal is to automate the resource provisioning process, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

**Running the Project:**
With the Python script and Terraform configuration ready, we'll guide you through running the project step by step. We'll cover deploying the infrastructure, preparing an image for processing, and executing the Python script to extract text. You'll witness the AI capabilities in action as text is extracted from the image you provide.

**Conclusion:**
In this blog post, we embarked on a journey to harness the capabilities of AI for text extraction from images using Azure Cognitive Services and Terraform. We demonstrated the power of automating infrastructure deployment and showcased how Python can be leveraged to interact with AI services seamlessly. As AI continues to advance, these practical skills become invaluable in developing innovative solutions that leverage the potential of AI-driven technologies. This project is just the beginning, and the possibilities are boundless as we explore the ever-expanding horizons of artificial intelligence.


Dies ist der Anfang einer Reihe von Artikeln rund um ein kleines ML Projekt, an dessem Ende eine funtionale Web-Applikaion entstehen soll, die Besuchern einer Webseite für Weinkenner zudätzliche Features bieten soll, um z..B Weine angand von Fotos der Flasche zu identifierzeren, zu kalsslifizieren und weitere informationen rund um den Wein zu bieten.

An dieser Stelle meinen Dank an meinen befreundeten TYPO3 Spezialisten Christoph Schweres, dem ich zum einen die Bilder und auch vile Informationen rum um wein verdanke.

Alle verwendeten Bilder sind vo der Webseite wein-fuer-jedermann.de entnommen. Wer mehr über weine erfahren will, dem sei ein Besuch herzlich empholen.

Genug der Werbung, ab in medias res



This marks the beginning of a series of articles centered around a small ML project, culminating in the creation of a functional web application. This application aims to offer additional features to visitors of a wine enthusiast website. For instance, it will enable users to identify and classify wines based on photos of the bottles. Furthermore, the application will provide additional information about the wines.

At this juncture, I'd like to extend my gratitude to my friend and TYPO3 specialist, Christoph Schweres. He has not only provided the images for this project, but also a wealth of information about wine.

All the images used are sourced from the website wein-fuer-jedermann.de. If you're eager to expand your knowledge about wines, I wholeheartedly recommend paying the site a visit.

But enough of the advertisement – let's dive straight into the heart of the matter!
